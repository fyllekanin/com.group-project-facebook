## Tools needed

### Git
https://consolejs.net/2022/08/04/git-setup/

### NodeJS (to work with the front-end)

#### Windows
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

#### Linux/MacOS
I recommend using NVM (Node Version Manager), then you can easily install/remove/change versions

https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating

Run the CURL command, then you can run "nvm install 16" and you will have NodeJS version 16 all ready to go

### Docker (to run the back-end)
